# Mark Description

The mark represents the graphical mark of the visualization. Draco uses an encoding based on the Grammar of Graphics (GoG) {cite}`wilkinson2012grammar`. In the GoG, marks are described as Geometric objects ("geoms" for short). We use the term mark as that's the term Vega-Lite {cite}`satyanarayan2016vega` uses.
