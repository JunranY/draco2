# Introduction

In this book, we describe a new version of Draco. Draco was first published in {cite}`moritz2018formalizing`.

Draco has three parts.

1. A general description language for visualizations as facts.
2. A knowledge base as constraints over facts. This knowledge base describes which visualizations are valid and what visualizations my be preferred.
3. An API to use the [Clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) solver to apply the knowledge base to visualizations described as a set of facts.

## Installation

TODO: set up and describe installation with conda.
