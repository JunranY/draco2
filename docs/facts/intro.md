# Overview

To express knowledge about visualizations, we first need a language to describe visualizations. Draco describes visualizations and context around them (e.g. properties of the data and task) as _facts_. In this section, we will describe the kinds of facts we chose for Draco.

```{note}
You could design your own description language and use it with Draco or extend the existing language we use here. If you add new information, Draco will not immediately use the new facts until you also add constraints over the facts.
